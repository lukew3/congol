		<h1>Rules</h1>
		<p>Congol is based off of John Conway's Game of Life. All of the original rules of Conway's Game of Life are kept in Congol. The original rules are as follows:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Survival: A cell surrounded by two or three cells survives for the next generation</li>
			<li>Death: A cell with 4 or more neighbors dies of overpopulation. A cell with one or no neighbors dies of isolation.</li>
			<li>Birth: An unoccupied square becomes a living cell if it has exactly 3 neighbors</li>
		</ol>
		<p>To make this game playable with multiple species of cells, a rule stating that the species that contributes the most to the birth of a new cell decides the species of the new cell.</p>
